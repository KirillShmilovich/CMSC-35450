# A Comparison of Generative Modelling Approaches for Conditional Molecular Structure GenerationLearning

## By: Mike Jones and Kirill Shmilovich

Comparisson of molecular trajectories generated for a 94-atom pentapeptide. The REAL trajectory is on the left, trajectory generated using a GAN is shown in the center, and the DDPM-generated trajectory is shown on the right.
